### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as a fulltime Software Development Engineer. I'm using `python` and `typescript` at my work, and learning `golang`, `databases`, `distributed sytems` outside office hours. Previously, I spent most of my time on researching and implementing Machine learning/ Deep learning models.
